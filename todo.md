## Various ideas on things that could be done

- [X] render voxels
- [X] simple materials
- [X] render multiple objects
- [X] load .vox files
    - [ ] some files just don't load the geometry correctly
    - [ ] transparency/materials
    - [ ] animations
- [ ] render octrees 
- [ ] better lighting
    - [ ] research PBR
    - [ ] ambient occlusion
    - [ ] shadows
    - [ ] emissive voxels
- [ ] editing voxel structures
- [ ] procedurally generated objects/structures
- [ ] testing with larger data
- [ ] create my own voxel file format
- [ ] unique materials/shaders (clouds, water, etc...)
