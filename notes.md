## TODO

 - Get a fpv camera working
 - Raycast into 3d texture with simple AABB raycasting
 - Load a .vox file, solve whatever problems come up, maybe work with materials

## Voxel Rendering Techniques and papers

 - The essential AABB raycasting algorithm [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2611491_A_Fast_Voxel_Traversal_Algorithm_for_Ray_Tracing) 
 - Different raycasting approach that might be better for dynamic scenes or non grid aligned voxels [paper](https://jcgt.org/published/0007/03/04/paper-lowres.pdf)

## Youtube channels with voxel engines

 - [Xima](https://www.youtube.com/@xima1): Minecraft clone, but with raytraced looking graphics
 - [Aurailus](https://www.youtube.com/@Aurailus): classic minecraft like rasterization engine with optimizations
 - [Douglas](https://www.youtube.com/@DouglasDwyer): Small voxels w/ physics goes into quite a bit of detail
 - [Grant Kot](https://www.youtube.com/@GrantKot): big into full voxel/particle water simulation
 - [Frozein](https://www.youtube.com/@frozein): Made a super pretty voxel game on a planet, is currently making an improved raycast engine, not too much content
 - [Gabe Rundlett](https://www.youtube.com/@GabeRundlett): some great content on dynamic raycast engines
