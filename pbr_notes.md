## Definitions

- Irradiance at a point: the amount of light incoming from all possible directions
- Radiance in a direction: the amount of light incoming from a specific direction

- A random snippet that might mean something at some point:

    The thing is that the BRDF definition assumes that there is radiance 𝐿𝑖(𝜔𝑖) 
    incoming to point 𝑥 through an infinitesimal cone d𝜔𝑖 around the direction 𝜔𝑖 with solid angle size denoted d𝜎(𝜔𝑖), 
    which then generates some irradiance on the surface. This "partial" irradiance is then denoted d𝐸(𝜔𝑖). 
    This incident light can be partially absorbed by the surface and partially scattered in all directions.
    The out-scattered contribution of d𝐸(𝜔𝑖) to radiance outgoing in direction 𝜔𝑜 is denoted as d𝐿𝑜(𝜔𝑜).


## Radiometric functions

 - functions for calculating the light radiation given a viewer, point, the points properties, other objects, and light sources in the scene
